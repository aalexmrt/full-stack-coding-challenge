# Stackless full-stack developer coding challenge

Your task is to build a Node.js (or Python) application that retrieves warehouse metrics from Snowflake, a cloud-based data warehousing platform. The application should store this information in a database table and display the metrics graphically over time in a front-end user interface.

## Requirements

### Retrieve Snowflake Warehouse Metrics
- Develop a Node.js (or Python) application that connects to the Snowflake using appropriate libraries or APIs using the following credentials:
  - username: interview_user
  - password: yHsrH^%M#7Lf
  - endpoint: https://gza68067.snowflakecomputing.com
  - role: interview_rl
  - warehouse: interview_wh
  - database: interview_db
- Create an API that retrieves relevant warehouse metrics such as database size in gb, total number of rows, total number of tables and _data points_ defined as the sum of the number of columns of each table times the number of rows for that table for each table in the database.

### Database Integration
- Create a database (you can choose a database system like PostgreSQL, MySQL, or SQLite).
- Store the retrieved warehouse metrics in the database with a timestamp for when they were retrieved in UTC.
  
### Front-end
- Develop a front-end interface using a framework - React.
- Display a table where users can view metrics over time that looks like this (the numbers are not accurate):

    | datetime      | database size | rows | tables | data points |
    |---            |---            |---   |---     |---          |
    | 2023-10-10 20:18:53| 6.1GB    | 1.24M|52      | 225.2M      |
    | 2023-10-11 07:09:21| 6.2GB    | 1.35M|52      | 227.8M      |

- *(Optional)* Display the metrics graphically using charts or graphs (you can use libraries like D3.js, Chart.js, or others).

### Docker and Docker Compose
- Package your application components (Back-end app, database, and front-end) into Docker containers.
- Use Docker Compose to orchestrate the deployment of the entire application stack.
- Provide clear instructions for building and running the application stack using Docker and Docker Compose.
